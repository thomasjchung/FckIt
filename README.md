# FckIt
Welcome to FckIt! This application allows video editors and content creators to drastically save their manual labor time by automatically cutting out specified words of your choosing and filling in the silence with an audio of your choosing!

Simply choose the file you want to censor, the audio file that you want to be replaced (it will elongate or shorten to match the censored word), and watch the magic work! Right now it just censors swear words, but YouTube TOS Standards and Custom Words coming soon!

Note: The Vercel Application is No Longer Hosted
